# 8 - Enterprise Content Management with app model #

----------

This module concentrates on how to achieve typical ECM capabilities using app model techniques. We will concentrate on typical information management policy and document management capabilities implemented for companies.  

**Agenda**
- Content types and site columns
- Managed Metadata CSOM
- Library and list templates with app model
- Document management automation


**Key recommendations**
- Create elements using CSOM, no XML
- Taxonomy CSOM is extremely powerful 
- Stop using xml list templates
- Remote timer job based governance solutions

**Lab - Using Enterprise Content Management Capabilities with app model**
In first lab you will create custom cross site collection navigation based on the term configuration in taxonomy store. In second lab you will build a small taxonomy tool which can be used for creating and reading terms in the Office 365. You can use this kind of process to access your on-premises farm terms and then replicate them to the cloud.
