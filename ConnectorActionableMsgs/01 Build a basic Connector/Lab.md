# Lab: Build a basic connector that works with Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Teams

In this lab, you will learn the steps to create and send connector cards to Office 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams, and learn the steps for registering a connector with the Office 365 Connectors Developer Dashboard.

## In this lab

1. [Create a card payload and submit it via an incoming webhook](#exercise1)
1. [Add functionality to an existing web site](#exercise2)
1. [Upload connector to Microsoft Teams](#exercise3)

## Prerequisites

This lab will require an Office 365 tenant and a user account that has a mailbox. The exercises that use Microsoft Teams require additional setup. The tenant setup steps are detailed on the [Getting Started page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup). Pay special attention to the sections **Prepare your Office 365 tenant** and **Get started with Teams App Studio**.

### Install developer tools

The developer workstation requires the following tools for this lab:

#### Download ngrok

The connector registration process requires an endpoint accessible from the internet via HTTPS. A tunneling application is required for the exercises to work correctly.

This lab uses [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for tunneling publicly-available HTTPS endpoints to a web server running locally on the developer workstation without an SSL certificate. ngrok is a single-file download that is run from a console.

#### Code editors

The steps and code samples in this lab use [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) for websites using C#.

## Exercise 1: Create a card payload and submit it via an incoming webhook

In this exercise, you will copy an example card from the Message Card Playground website and send it to an Office 365 group in your tenant.

### Create a group and configure the webhook

1. Open a browser and go to [Microsoft Outlook](https://outlook.office.com). Log in with your Office 365 credentials.
1. Create a new group, or select an existing group.
1. At the top-right of the screen, select the gear in the content area (not the suite bar).

    ![Screenshot of Outlook.com Group inbox, with arrow indicating the Group settings gear](Images/Exercise1-07.png)

1. Select **Connectors**.

    ![Screenshot of group settings menu](Images/Exercise1-01.png)

1. In the list of connectors, scroll down and select **Incoming Webhook**.

    ![Screenshot of list of Connectors with incoming webhook highlighted](Images/Exercise1-02.png)

1. Enter a name for the connector and select **Create**.
1. The page will re-display, now including a URL for the connector. Use the icon next to the URL to copy it to the clipboard.

    ![Screenshot of incoming webhook with URL](Images/Exercise1-03.png)

    > Note: The URL will be used several times in this exercise, as will the clipboard. We recommend pasting the URL into Notepad or other application.

1. Select **Done**. Then close the Connector and Group settings menus.

### Explore MessageCard playground

1. In another browser tab or window, navigate to [MessageCard Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net).
1. The playground site provides for uploading a custom card definition or reviewing several samples. Use the **select a sample** dropdown to select a sample. This lab requires that the sample uses the **Legacy MessageCard samples** at the bottom of the dropdown.

    ![Screenshot of message card sample](Images/Exercise1-04.png)

    > Note: Choosing an **Adaptive Card Sample** may result in an error in the next section of the lab.

### Send card via PowerShell

It is not necessary to use the playground website to send test messages. Any facility for sending HTTP POST requests can also send cards to the group.

1. Select the JSON of a card from the MessageCard Playground and copy it to Notepad.
1. Save the card source as **connector-card.json**.
1. Open **Windows PowerShell** and change to the directory containing the **connector-card.json** file.
1. Execute the following commands:

    ```powershell
    $message = Get-Content .\connector-card.json
    $url = <YOUR WEBHOOK URL>
    Invoke-RestMethod -ContentType "application/json" -Body $message -Uri $url -Method Post
    ```

    ![Screenshot of PowerShell command](Images/Exercise1-06.png)

    > The `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet will return **1** to indicate success.

### Run the ngrok secure tunnel application

1. Open a new **Command Prompt** window.

1. Change to the directory that contains the **ngrok.exe** application.

1. Run the command `ngrok http [port] -host-header=localhost:[port]`. Replace `[port]` with the port portion of the URL noted above.

1. The ngrok application will fill the entire prompt window. Make note of the forwarding address using HTTPS. This address is required in the next step.

1. Minimize the ngrok command prompt window. It is no longer referenced in this lab, but it must remain running.

    ![Screenshot of ngrok command prompt with local host highlighted.](./Images/Exercise2-02.png)

### Register the connector

1. Go to the [Connector Developer Portal](https://aka.ms/connectorsdashboard) and sign in with your Office 365 credentials.

1. Provide a name, logo, short description and detailed description for your connector.

1. For the **Company website** field, use the HTTPS forwarding address from the ngrok tunnel.

1. For the **Configuration page for your Connector** field, use the forwarding HTTPS address from ngrok prepended to the route to the connector page. For this exercise, the route is `/content/connectorConfig.html`.

    ```html
    https://[from-ngrok].ngrok.io/content/connectorConfig.html
    ```

1. For the **Valid domains** field, use the domain of the forwarding HTTPS address from ngrok. Do not include the scheme, only the domain.

    ```html
    [from-ngrok].ngrok.io
    ```

1. Agree to the terms and conditions and select **Save**.

1. The registration page will refresh. The refreshed page URL will contain the **id** of the connector. Make note of this **Connector Id** for use in the configuration page.
