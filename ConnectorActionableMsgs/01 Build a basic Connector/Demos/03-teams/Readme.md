    ````json
    "icons": {

      "color": "connector-icon-color.png"
    },
    ````

1. Copy the image files `Lab Files/Teams/connector-icon-20x20.png` and `Lab Files/Teams/connector-icon-96x96.png` to the directory with the downloaded manifest.

1. In **Windows Explorer**, select the `manifest.json`, `connector-icon-outline.png` and `connector-icon-color.png` files. Right-click and select **Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder**. Name the zip file **ToDoConnector.zip**.
