# Demo: Sideload the Connector to Microsoft Teams

To complete this demo, the prerequisites for developing Apps for Microsoft Teams must be completed. The setup steps are detailed on the [Getting Started page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/setup). Pay special attention to the sections **Prepare your Office 365 tenant** and **Use Teams App Studio**.

To run this demo, perfom the following steps:

## Sideload app into Microsoft Teams

Side loading a Microsoft Teams Connector requires a zip file containing a manifest that describes the connector along with related resources.

1. From the connector setup page, select the **Download Manifest** button which will download the manifest.json file to your machine.

1. Open the manifest.json file in an editor and replace the `icons` section with the following json and save the file.

    ````json
    "icons": {
      "outline": "connector-icon-20x20.png",
      "color": "connector-icon-96x96.png"
    },
    ````

1. Add the manifest.json plus the `Lab Files/Teams/connector-icon-20x20.png` and `Lab Files/Teams/connector-icon-96x96.png` to a zip file. In this demo, the zip file is named **TeamsConnector.zip**.

1. In the Microsoft Teams application, select the **Add team** link. Then select the **Create team** button.
