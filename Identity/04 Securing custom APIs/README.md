# Microsoft Identity Training Module - Secure custom APIs with Microsoft Identity

Many solutions involve creating web APIs to expose functionality to different clients and consumers. Developers can secure these APIs using Microsoft identity to ensure only approved apps can access the web APIs provided they've been granted the necessary permissions. In this module, you’ll learn how to secure a web API with Microsoft identity and how to call it from another application.

> This module is also published as a Microsoft Learn module: [Secure custom APIs with Microsoft Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/identity-secure-custom-api)

## Lab - Secure custom APIs with Microsoft Identity

The lab for this module is available in multiple units within the associated Microsoft Learn module. Use the following links to jump to the specific unit. Each Microsoft Learn unit represents a different lab exercise & demo in the presentation.

1. [Exercise - Create and secure a web API with Microsoft identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/identity-secure-custom-api/3-exercise-secure-api-microsoft-identity)

    > In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create a .NET Core web API application and secure it with Microsoft identity.

1. [Exercise - Call secured APIs from web applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/identity-secure-custom-api/5-exercise-call-secured-apis-webapps)

    > In this unit, you’ll learn how to create server-side web apps that enable users to sign in and grant the app permissions to act on the user’s behalf. Once the user has authenticated and granted the app consent to act on their behalf, the web application will use data returned from a secure web API by using the OAuth 2.0 auth code grant flow.

1. [Exercise - Leverage app roles to secure custom APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/identity-secure-custom-api/7-exercise-leverage-app-roles)

    > In this exercise, you'll learn how to add app roles (application permission) to an Azure AD Application registration and consume a secured API from a daemon application.
