# Microsoft Identity Training Module - Application Types

The Microsoft identity platform enables developers to build many different types of applications to satisfy diverse business requirements and different scenarios. By supporting multiple OAuth 2.0 standard authentication protocols, developers can create different types of applications that meet business needs including single page applications, web apps, mobile or native apps and services or daemon apps. In this module, you’ll learn how you can implement different authentication protocols in popular application types.

> This module is also published as a Microsoft Learn module: [Application Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msidentity-application-types)

## Lab - Application Types

The lab for this module is available in multiple units within the associated Microsoft Learn module. Use the following links to jump to the specific unit. Each Microsoft Learn unit represents a different lab exercise & demo in the presentation.

1. [Exercise - Single Page Applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msidentity-application-types/3-exercise-single-page-applications)

    > In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create, configure and use Azure AD applications that use data returned from Microsoft Graph in single page applications by leveraging the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow.

1. [Exercise - Web apps that sign in users & call APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msidentity-application-types/5-exercise-web-apps-call-apis)

    > In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create server-side web apps that allow users to sign in and grant the app permissions to act on the user’s behalf. One the user has authenticated and granted the app consent to act on their behalf, the web application will use data returned from Microsoft Graph by using the OAuth 2.0 auth code grant flow.

1. [Exercise - Daemon and non-interactive apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msidentity-application-types/7-exercise-daemon-non-interactive-apps)

    > In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create apps that obtain tokens without user interaction to either act on behalf of a user or perform tasks as the app’s identity.
