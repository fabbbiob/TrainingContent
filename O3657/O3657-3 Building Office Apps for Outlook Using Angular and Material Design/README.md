Building Office Apps for Outlook Using Angular and Material Design
================================================================
Like other modules in this course (O3657), this module focuses on using non-Microsoft technologies. It has been written for developers working on OS X and not using Visual Studio as the development environment to create Apps for Office. 

Many things in the module only apply to OS X such as configuring a self-signed certificate (*[explained in these steps](self-signed-cert-osx.md)*) & hosting a local web server for the app. Be aware of this if you are using this lab on a Windows and/or Visual Studio based development environment.

If you are developing on Windows and using Visual Studio, refer to course [O3652 - Deep dive into the Office 365 App Model](../../O3652) that contains modules that demonstrate how to create Apps for Office using this type of an environment.

Unlike many of the labs in these training courses, this lab will demonstrate how to create an app will demonstrate creating apps from OS X using the freely available [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor by Adobe.
 
However you can use any host operating system (*Windows, OS X, Linux, etc*) and any text editor (*Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, WebStorm, EMACS, Vim, etc*) to create the Office App. This is because Office Apps are simply text-based web applications (*HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & images*) with a single XML file to describe the application.
