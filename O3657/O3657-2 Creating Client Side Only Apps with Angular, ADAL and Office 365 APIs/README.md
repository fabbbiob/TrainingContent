Creating Client-Side Only Apps with Angular, ADAL & Office 365 APIs
===================================================================

This module currently contains a completed solution that:

- is 100% client-side (zero server-side code)
- uses the ADAL JS library to authenticate using the OAuth2 Implicit Flow
- calls the SharePoint Online & Office 365 Files API to demonstrate support for CORS
- is built using Angular 1.3.x

In the near future this module will contain a full hands-on lab.
